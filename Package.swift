import PackageDescription

// Tests only. The app is built by Music.xcodeproj; this package exists so the pure
// logic can be tested with `swift test` on a plain macOS runner -- no simulator, no
// second Xcode target, and no risk of a bad project-file edit breaking the app build.
//
// It compiles the *same* files the app compiles, listed explicitly rather than by
// directory: every file here must be Foundation-only, and naming them keeps a future
// UIKit import from silently breaking the test job.
