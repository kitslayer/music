///
/// - A play is submitted once accumulated listening passes half the track or four
///   minutes, whichever comes first. Accumulated, not wall clock: scrubbing to the
///   end must not scrobble, and pausing for an hour mid-song must not either.
/// - The submission carries the moment the track *started*, not the moment the
///   request goes out. That is what keeps history honest when a scrobble is flushed
///   from the outbox days later.
///
/// Deliberately knows nothing about the network: the sink is injected, so the
/// direct-to-server version here and the durable outbox that replaces it later are
/// the same code path from the tracker's point of view.
