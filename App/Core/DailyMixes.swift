/// Mixes, as many as you keep asking for, stable for the day.
///
/// The reason this can exist at all is that the app keeps its own play log: the server
/// knows *how many* times a track was played but not *when*, so "what you have been into
/// lately" is not a question Subsonic can answer. `MixEngine` does the choosing; this
/// fetches the candidates and remembers the result.
///
/// Built in **pages**, from a list of recipes rather than a fixed set of three. Reaching
/// the end of the shelf asks for more, and so does listening — the ideas do not run out
/// before the cap does: a dozen favourite artists, sixteen genres each with a played and
/// an unheard version, seven decades. Nothing is ever built twice, because a page picks up
/// where the last one left off and shares one `used` set with it.
///
/// Stable for the day, though: a mix that changes while you are looking at it is not a
/// mix. Pages already built are cached, so scrolling back is free and a relaunch resumes
/// mid-list.
