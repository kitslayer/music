/// The constraints here are not stylistic. Both producers — `AVAudioEngine`'s tap block
/// and `MTAudioProcessingTap`'s process callback — run on a **real-time audio thread**,
/// where allocating, locking, or hopping to an actor causes dropouts or worse. So:
///
/// - the storage is allocated once, up front, and never grows
/// - `write` does one `memcpy` and one integer update, nothing else
/// - there is no lock anywhere, in either direction
///
/// The consequence is that a `snapshot` taken while a write is in flight can contain a
/// seam — a few samples from the previous revolution of the ring. For a spectrum
/// display that is invisible, and it is the right trade: a torn frame of a visualiser
/// costs nothing, whereas blocking the audio thread costs the music.
///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` states that deliberately, rather than pretending the races
/// away with a lock that must not exist.
