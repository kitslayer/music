/// The webhook is write-only — it returns 202 the moment it accepts a request and the
/// agent's reply goes to its own delivery channel, which the app cannot read. So anything
/// that needs an answer back uses a mailbox: the app mints a request id, the agent writes
/// `<id>.json` into a directory on the server, and a read-only static server hands it over.
/// **404 means the run is still going; 200 means it finished** — which is why a missing file
/// is `pending` rather than an error.
///
/// Signing is the gateway's V2 scheme: HMAC-SHA256 over `"<timestamp>.<body>"`. V1 signs the
/// body alone, so a captured request replays forever; this only ever sends V2, and the
/// gateway rejects anything older than five minutes.
