/// Navidrome's own API, used for the one thing Subsonic cannot answer: **when**.
///
/// Subsonic exposes a `playCount` and no dates for songs — `getAlbumList2?type=recent`
/// sorts *albums* by last play and that is the whole of it. Navidrome's native API sorts
/// songs by `playDate` and returns it, which is what makes a real "recently played" list
/// and an all-time top-tracks list possible, covering **every** device and every play
/// including the ones imported from Plex.
///
/// Worth being precise about what is and is not here: Navidrome does keep a per-play
/// event log — a `scrobbles` table with a timestamp per play — but **neither API exposes
/// it**. So per-play analysis (time of day, streaks) still has to come from the app's own
/// history, while totals and last-played come from here and reach back through the whole
/// library.
///
/// A second auth scheme, unavoidably: this endpoint wants a JWT, not the salted-MD5 that
/// every Subsonic call uses.
